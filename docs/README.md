# e2e testing library

Library for ui e2e testing.

You can write tests in snippets in the browser or write them in spec files in the tests folder and run them in the browser.

The tests are based on jest describe / test syntax. The assertions are based on React testing library, Cypress and Playwright.
These tests easily be ported to those testing frameworks.
